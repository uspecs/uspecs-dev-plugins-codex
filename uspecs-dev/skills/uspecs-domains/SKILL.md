## Artifacts

Domain Design Specification artifacts:

- Domain Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/domain.md`
- Bounded Context Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/{context}/context.md`
  - Owns the Bounded Context's Ubiquitous Language, relationships, tactical design, lifecycle, and behavior
  - Owns all Tactical Design Elements for that Context; the framework does not define separate object specification artifacts

## Domain Specification guidance

Use the `Domain` and `Subdomain` rules in `## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts` when authoring or reviewing `domain.md`.

## Bounded Context Specification guidance

Use the `Bounded Context (Context)`, relationship, Tactical Design Elements, and Feature rules in `## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts` when authoring or reviewing `context.md`.

## Specification style

When creating a new Domain Design Specification, follow the style used in this skill's example Domain and Bounded Context specifications unless the task or project instructions specify a different style.

When patching an existing Domain Design Specification, preserve its section, diagram, relationship-notation, and context-marker style unless the task asks to restyle it.

## Element naming and references

Covers external actors and named Tactical Design Elements.

- Names are single-token PascalCase; existing acronym capitalization is preserved, e.g. `AIAgent`, `SRE`, `CatalogManager`
- An element may carry an optional decorator, fixed at its declaration: `👤` for roles, `⚙️` for systems; tactical elements have no decorator by default
- The bare form `{decorator} {name}` (no backticks) is used at the declaration and in structural listings: `External actors` entries, relationship Consumer/Provider party lists, and diagram or relationship-graph labels (Mermaid and ASCII render no backticks), e.g. 👤 Engineer, ⚙️ AIAgent, ChangeFolder
- The backticked form `{decorator} {name}` is used for an inline reference in running prose or a table cell, e.g. `👤 Engineer`, `⚙️ AIAgent`, `ChangeFolder`; when no decorator was declared the reference is `{name}` in backticks
- Drop a preceding article before an inline reference in prose, e.g. write "reports to `👤 Engineer`" rather than "reports to the Engineer"
- Mirror each element's declared decorator; do not add or remove a decorator unless the task asks to restyle the spec

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts

### Domain

Target subject area of a computer system (product).

- Strategic, problem space
- Type: Business | Technical
  - Business Domain: the product delivered to customers
  - Technical Domain: building, delivering, deploying, and operating the Business Domain product
- Identified by its folder name; example domains are `prod` and `devops`
  - `prod`: Business Domain. The business logic and customer-facing capabilities - what the product does for its users
  - `devops`: Technical Domain. Building, delivering, deploying, and operating the Business Domain product — development, testing, artifact delivery, deployment, and operations (monitoring, observability, incident response)
- Title: `# Domain: {slug}`, e.g. `# Domain: prod`
- Describes
  - Executive summary
    - Scope
    - Out of scope
  - Subdomains
    - One subsection per subdomain: `### {Name} ({Type})`, where type is `Core`, `Supporting`, or `Generic`
    - Each subdomain subsection contains a short purpose statement
    - Each subdomain subsection contains a capability table with columns `Capability` and `Realized by`
      - `Realized by` contains Bounded Context links or names that realize the capability
  - Shared external actors
    - Section heading: `## Shared external actors`
    - Explanatory sentence: "Actors shared across multiple bounded contexts; context-specific actors are documented in their respective context specifications."
    - List only actors shared between multiple contexts in this domain
    - Roles are actor categories defined by the domain's Bounded Contexts, e.g. RBAC roles such as `Shopper` or `SupportAgent`
    - Systems are external non-role actors outside the Bounded Context boundary, such as software services, devices, platforms, or infrastructure
    - Roles and systems may be authorized through RBAC, scopes, claims, service accounts, mTLS identities, or other access-control mechanisms
    - Generic consumers such as `API consumers` are avoided when a role or system boundary is known
    - Each actor carries a domain-wide role description (abstract/general)
    - Actor naming, the `👤`/`⚙️` decorators, and the declaration-vs-reference style follow `## Element naming and references`
  - Domain-level vocabulary or glossary
    - Do not create a domain-level vocabulary or glossary section by default
    - When an existing Domain spec already has one, maintain it and add broad domain-level framing terms when relevant
    - Canonical modeled concepts live in Bounded Context specifications; cross-Context language dependencies are documented through relationship and model-alignment views
  - Bounded Contexts
    - Context list
      - Links to each Bounded Context and a short purpose summary
    - `### Service exposure`
      - Mermaid graph of service exposure relationships
    - `### Service exposure index`
      - Table columns: `Upstream`, `Downstream`, `Contract`, `Exposure`, `Alignment`
      - `Alignment` contains the model-alignment stance carried by the service or integration contract, when present
    - `### Model alignment`
      - Mermaid graph of standalone model alignment relationships
    - `### Model alignment index`
      - Table columns: `Upstream`, `Downstream`, `Model/language`, `Alignment`
      - Contains standalone model/language relationships only
    - Relationship index tables
      - Rows sorted by `Upstream`
      - Full pattern names, e.g. `Open Host Service`, `Published Language`, `Conformist`, `Anti-Corruption Layer`
    - Relationship graphs follow `Relationship graph rules`
    - Domain-level Context Maps and relationship indexes contain Bounded Contexts only; external actors stay in `External actors`

### Subdomain

A distinct part of the problem space within a Domain.

- Type: Core | Supporting | Generic — a statement of business value, evaluated independently of the software design, that drives build-vs-buy and staffing
  - Core Subdomain: provides the organization's competitive advantage and strategic value; built in-house with the best people and the richest model, and evolved continuously
  - Supporting Subdomain: necessary for the business and supports the Core, but not a competitive differentiator; built, but with minimal investment
  - Generic Subdomain: common functionality not specific to the business; acquired, adopted off-the-shelf, or reused rather than built as a strategic asset
  - Classification is always measured against business competitive advantage, regardless of the parent Domain's type: in a Business Domain advantage is direct (customer-facing); in a Technical Domain it is indirect — Core only where the business moat depends on the capability, so most Technical Subdomains are Supporting or Generic
- Delivers one or more capabilities, each realized by one or more Bounded Contexts — a Subdomain-to-Context relationship that is many-to-many

### Bounded Context (Context)

A model boundary in the solution space, with a specific set of actors, concepts, operations, and rules, realizing one or more Subdomains

- Primary indicators
  - Low coupling to other Contexts
  - Autonomy of evolution (components evolve independently)
  - Team/organizational responsibility
  - Data autonomy
  - A concept with its own lifecycle and model can be a separate Context; if it is only an attribute or target name, it normally belongs inside the Context that uses it
- Naming: noun (normally plural) or noun phrase
  - Examples: `payments`, `reviews`
- Title: `# Bounded Context: {slug}`, e.g. `# Bounded Context: checkout`
- Solution space, both strategic (boundary) and tactical (the model and canonical vocabulary that realize it)
- Describes
  - Executive summary
    - Scope
    - Out of scope
  - External actors
    - List all actors (roles and systems) this context interacts with
    - Each actor carries a context-specific role description
    - Context-specific descriptions explain what the actor does within this context's boundary
    - Actor naming, the `👤`/`⚙️` decorators, and the declaration-vs-reference style follow `## Element naming and references`
  - `## Relationships` section
    - Relationship graphs follow `Relationship graph rules`
    - Relationship entries follow `Relationship documentation`
  - Vocabulary rule: the tactical model is the canonical Ubiquitous Language for the Context
    - Do not create a separate `## Ubiquitous Language` section by default
    - When an existing Context spec already has a `## Ubiquitous Language` section, maintain it and preserve the artifact's section style
    - Do not duplicate terms already represented by tactical model elements in `## Ubiquitous Language`
    - Tactical-element naming and the declaration-vs-reference style follow `## Element naming and references`, e.g. `ChangeFolder`, `ReviewItem`, `PluginInstallation`
    - Use the same model names in scenarios and specifications when referring to named domain concepts; avoid parallel spellings such as `Review Item` and `ReviewItem`
    - Plain prose may use normal English, but a named domain noun should resolve to one Entity, Value Object, Aggregate, Factory, Repository, Service, Event, or an attribute of an existing model element
    - Add or keep vocabulary notes for boundary-specific terms that are intentionally not represented by the model; prefer adding the missing model element when the term has identity, structure, behavior, lifecycle, or invariants
  - Tactical Design Elements stay inside `context.md`: structural elements are documented in `## Model specification`; contract-relevant behavior and lifecycle elements may be documented in `## Lifecycle and behavior`
  - `## Model specification` section
    - Tactical element headings use PascalCase and are the canonical domain names for scenarios, specifications, and implementation-facing references
    - Use `### Entities` and `### Value Objects` as the default structural subsections; include a subsection only when objects of that kind exist
    - Sort top-level Entity subsections alphabetically by Aggregate Root or independent Entity name
    - Mark Aggregate Root Entities in top-level Entity headings with `(aggregate)`, e.g. `#### Order (aggregate)`
    - Document Entities owned by an Aggregate as nested subsections under the Aggregate Root Entity, sorted alphabetically, e.g. `##### OrderLine`
      - Put Aggregate Root fields, invariants, state transitions, and `ERD:` before nested owned Entity subsections
    - Describe aggregate ownership inside Entity subsections using concise ownership lines such as `Contains:`, `Embeds:`, `References:`, or `Owned by:`
    - Sort Value Object subsections alphabetically by canonical model name
    - Include only named Value Objects that scenarios, specifications, fields, invariants, or relationship contracts need to reference directly
    - Entity and Value Object subsections may include a field table with `Field`, `Type`, and `Description` columns
    - Document invariants and state transitions under the relevant Entity subsection, especially the Aggregate Root Entity for aggregate-wide rules, when they define allowed model states or impossible states across scenarios
    - Aggregate Root Entity subsections should include an `ERD:` block when the Aggregate encloses multiple model elements or when the aggregate boundary is otherwise easy to misread
      - Aggregate ERDs show only aggregate-local structure and containment/reference relationships
      - Only identity-bearing Entities may use `PK`; do not mark Value Object fields as `PK` or `FK`
      - Value Objects in ERDs are embedded structures; show embedded relationships with labels such as `embeds`
    - Context-level `### ERD`, when present, shows cross-model structure across the Context
    - ERDs show structural fields only; full field semantics live in object subsections
      - Structural fields: identifiers, references, lifecycle state, relationship-bearing fields, aggregate-boundary fields, and invariant-bearing fields
  - `## Lifecycle and behavior` section is optional; do not create it by default
    - Add it only for Factories, Repositories, Services, or Events referenced in a relationship Detail subsection (`### Service exposure` / `### Model alignment`)
    - Do not use it to restate scenario/application actions, feature workflows, or Gherkin steps

### Relationship graph rules

- Apply to Domain-level Context Maps and Context-level `## Relationships`
- Graphs are either `Service exposure` or `Model alignment`
- `Service exposure`
  - Runtime or exchange contract exposed by an upstream/provider and consumed by downstream actors or Contexts
  - Examples include UIs, request/response APIs, commands, queries, event/message channels, feeds, exports/imports, files, streams, and external system interfaces
  - Provider determination: the upstream/provider is the side that owns and exposes the contract (endpoint, API, channel, interface, file, or feed); the downstream/consumer is the side that calls, reads, subscribes to, or pushes into that contract
    - This is independent of connection initiation and data/request direction: a consumer that pushes data into a provider's endpoint is still downstream (e.g. a client pushing to an ingest API, or a partner calling a placement API)
    - Common patterns: (a) consumer calls provider's API → provider upstream; (b) consumer pushes into provider's endpoint → provider still upstream (owns the endpoint)
  - May include external roles and systems
  - May carry model alignment; that alignment stays with the service exposure relationship
  - Edge styles: `--->` for Open Host Service; `-..->` for Customer-Supplier
  - `Open Host Service (ohs)`: upstream exposes a public, general-purpose contract for many consumers
  - `Customer-Supplier (c/s)`: upstream provides a contract tailored to one or a few known downstream consumers
- `Model alignment`
  - Standalone relationship about how one Context depends on, adopts, or translates another Context's language/model
  - Scope: model/language dependencies not carried by a service or integration contract, such as reference terminology, conceptual models, shared classification schemes, or design-time schemas that are not themselves an exchange contract
  - Contains Bounded Contexts only; external roles and systems stay in `External actors` and may appear in `Service exposure`
  - If an external actor's service contract carries model alignment, document that alignment in the Service exposure relationship suffix/details, e.g. `(ohs + cf)` or `(ohs + acl)`, not as a standalone Model alignment edge
  - Edge styles: `===>` for Published Language; `--->` for Conformist; `-..->` for Anti-Corruption Layer
  - `Published Language (pl)`: upstream publishes a documented, versioned language/model
  - `Conformist (cf)`: downstream adopts the upstream model as-is, without the upstream publishing a separate formal language for this relationship
  - `Anti-Corruption Layer (acl)`: downstream translates the upstream model into its own model
- Arrows point upstream -> downstream (provider -> consumer). Arrow direction does not encode runtime data, request, or call flow
- Edge labels name the carried contract/concept as a noun phrase (e.g. `order placement API`, `payment authorization`), never a flow verb (e.g. `push samples`, `writes to`). At most three words
- Edge labels do not include pattern suffixes
- Edge styles encode relationship patterns
- Runtime data/request flow is not modeled here; capture it in a Technical Design Specification (see the `uspecs-td` skill), not in Service exposure or Model alignment graphs

### Relationship documentation

- Applies to Context-level detailed relationship entries
- Context-level relationship views cover Bounded Contexts, roles, and external systems that directly provide or consume the focal Context's contracts
- Sections: `### Service exposure`, `### Model alignment`
- Each section includes
  - Mermaid graph following `Relationship graph rules`; the focal Context has a distinct node shape
  - Detail subsections for relationships documented in that section
    - Entry order in a Context: incoming relationships first, sorted by upstream name; outgoing/provider relationships second, sorted by downstream name or by provided contract name for one-to-many contracts
- Detail subsections
  - Headings
    - `#### {upstream} -> {downstream}: {carried concept} ({pattern})`
    - `#### {provider}: {provided interface, language, or model} ({pattern})` for one-to-many provided contracts
    - Pattern suffix
      - Service only: one service exposure pattern in a relationship detail heading under `### Service exposure`, e.g. `(ohs)`, `(c/s)`
      - Service plus model alignment: a composed suffix in a single relationship detail heading under `### Service exposure`, e.g. `(ohs + pl)`, `(ohs + cf)`, `(ohs + acl)`, or the same model suffixes with `c/s`
      - Standalone model alignment: one model-alignment pattern in a relationship detail heading under `### Model alignment`, e.g. `(pl)`, `(cf)`, `(acl)`; only for model/language relationships not carried by a service or integration contract
        - Example: `#### catalog -> search: product classification (acl)`
          - `Upstream:` describes the published or referenced model/language
          - `Downstream:` describes local use or translation into local concepts such as `SearchFacet` and `SearchIndexCategory`
          - No API, event/message channel, feed, export/import, file, or other exchange contract is exposed for this relationship
  - Body shape
    - Do not repeat party names in body bullets when the heading already names them
    - For one-to-one relationships, use role blocks:
      - `Upstream:` for the provider or model source
      - `Downstream:` for the consumer or model user
    - For one-to-many provider contracts, use role blocks:
      - `Provider:` for the exposed service, interface, channel, language, or contract
      - `Consumers:` for each role, system, or Context consuming the contract
    - For external providers with no Context spec, put provider documentation under `Upstream:` and local adaptation or translation notes under `Downstream:`
  - Canonical cross-context details live with the artifact being made canonical:
    - Exposed service or integration contract details live in the upstream/provider Context
    - Published Language (`pl`) details live in the upstream/provider Context
    - Conformist (`cf`) model-alignment details live in the downstream Context that conforms:
      - For service-backed relationships such as `(ohs + cf)` or `(c/s + cf)`, the upstream/provider Context owns the canonical service or integration contract details; the downstream owns its local conformity notes
      - For standalone Conformist (`cf`) model alignment, the upstream should list known downstream conformists, but the detailed relationship entry lives downstream because the upstream publishes no separate formal language for that relationship
    - If the provider is external and has no Context spec, the consuming Context owns local adaptation or translation notes and links to the external provider reference
  - Consumer role blocks keep summaries, local conformity/adaptation notes, and links to the provider Context or external provider reference
- A model stance already described as part of a service exposure relationship has no separate `### Model alignment` entry

### Tactical Design Elements

- `Entity`
  - Definition: has identity and lifecycle (e.g., User, Order, Article)
  - Rule: document top-level Entities under `### Entities`, sorted alphabetically by Aggregate Root or independent Entity name; mark Aggregate Root Entities with `(aggregate)` in the heading
  - Rule: document Entities owned by an Aggregate as nested subsections under the owning Aggregate Root Entity
  - Rule: an Entity instance belongs to one Aggregate; other Aggregates reference the owning Aggregate Root identity instead of sharing the Entity instance
- `Value Object`
  - Definition: defined by attributes, immutable, no identity (e.g., Address, Money)
  - Rule: document named Value Object types under `### Value Objects`, sorted alphabetically, only when scenarios, specifications, fields, invariants, or relationship contracts need to reference them directly
- `Aggregate`
  - Definition: a cluster of Entities and Value Objects treated as a single consistency boundary; external references point only at its `Aggregate Root`, which enforces the aggregate's invariants
  - Rule: document the Aggregate on its Root Entity subsection using `(aggregate)` in the heading and ownership lines such as `Contains:`, `Embeds:`, and `References:`
  - Include an aggregate-local ERD under the Aggregate Root Entity when the boundary encloses multiple model elements or would otherwise be ambiguous
- `Service`
  - Encapsulates a domain operation that does not naturally belong to a single Entity or Value Object
  - Include only when it is part of a stable domain, API, or integration contract, or a cross-model domain capability that other specifications depend on; scenario/application actions stay in Functional Design Specifications
- `Event`
  - Immutable record of a meaningful domain occurrence
  - Include only when it is used across Contexts or Relationships, such as integration contracts, published languages, event channels, or important cross-context lifecycle signals
- `Repository`
  - Collection-like access to Aggregate Roots that hides storage details
  - Include only when access or persistence semantics are part of a domain contract; otherwise document aggregate access constraints under the relevant Aggregate when needed, and leave storage details to Technical Design or implementation
- `Factory`
  - Encapsulates complex creation of Entities or Aggregates so invariants hold from creation
  - Include only when creation semantics are part of a domain contract; otherwise document creation invariants under the relevant Entity or Aggregate when needed

### Feature

Cohesive set of scenarios within a Context.

- Single object: operations on the same object
- Cross-object: related operations across multiple objects (workflow)
- Can involve multiple actors
- Context contains features, feature belongs to exactly one Context
- Context defines the nouns (entities); feature defines the behavior over them (actions/verbs)
- Feature workflows and scenario/application actions are specified in Functional Design Specifications, not as Context `Service` elements unless they meet the Service rule above
