## Artifacts

Domain Design Specification artifacts:

- Domain Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/domain.md`
- Bounded Context Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/{context}/context.md`
  - Owns the Bounded Context's Ubiquitous Language, relationships, tactical design, lifecycle, and behavior
  - Owns all Tactical Design Elements for that Context; the framework does not define separate object specification artifacts

## Domain Specification guidance

Use the `Domain` and `Subdomain` rules in `## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts` when authoring or reviewing `domain.md`.

## Bounded Context Specification guidance

Use the `Bounded Context (Context)`, relationship, Tactical Design Elements, and Feature rules in `## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts` when authoring or reviewing `context.md`.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts

- `Domain`
  - Target subject area of a computer system (product)
  - Strategic, problem space
  - Type: Business | Technical
    - Business Domain: the product delivered to customers
    - Technical Domain: building, delivering, deploying, and operating the Business Domain product
  - Identified by its folder name; example domains are `prod` and `devops`
    - `prod`: Business Domain. The business logic and customer-facing capabilities - what the product does for its users
    - `devops`: Technical Domain. Building, delivering, deploying, and operating the Business Domain product — development, testing, artifact delivery, deployment, and operations (monitoring, observability, incident response)
  - Title: `# Domain: {slug}`, e.g. `# Domain: prod`
  - Describes
    - Executive summary
      - Scope
      - Out of scope
    - Subdomains
      - One subsection per subdomain: `### {Name} ({Type})`, where type is `Core`, `Supporting`, or `Generic`
      - Each subdomain subsection contains a short purpose statement
      - Each subdomain subsection contains a capability table with columns `Capability` and `Bounded Context(s)`
    - External actors
      - Roles are actor categories defined by the domain's Bounded Contexts, e.g. RBAC roles such as `Shopper` or `Support Agent`
      - Systems are external non-role actors outside the Bounded Context boundary, such as software services, devices, platforms, or infrastructure
      - Roles and systems may be authorized through RBAC, scopes, claims, service accounts, mTLS identities, or other access-control mechanisms
      - Generic consumers such as `API consumers` are avoided when a role or system boundary is known
    - Bounded Contexts
      - Context list
        - Links to each Bounded Context and a short purpose summary
      - `### Service exposure`
        - Mermaid graph of service exposure relationships
      - `### Service exposure index`
        - Table columns: `Upstream`, `Downstream`, `Contract`, `Exposure`, `Alignment`
        - `Alignment` contains the model-alignment stance carried by the service or integration contract, when present
      - `### Model alignment`
        - Mermaid graph of standalone model alignment relationships
      - `### Model alignment index`
        - Table columns: `Upstream`, `Downstream`, `Model/language`, `Alignment`
        - Contains standalone model/language relationships only
      - Relationship index tables
        - Rows sorted by `Upstream`
        - Full pattern names, e.g. `Open Host Service`, `Published Language`, `Conformist`, `Anti-Corruption Layer`
      - Relationship graphs follow `Relationship graph rules`
      - Domain-level Context Maps and relationship indexes contain Bounded Contexts only; external actors stay in `External actors`

- `Subdomain`: a distinct part of the problem space within a Domain
  - Type: Core | Supporting | Generic — a statement of business value, evaluated independently of the software design, that drives build-vs-buy and staffing
    - Core Subdomain: provides the organization's competitive advantage and strategic value; built in-house with the best people and the richest model, and evolved continuously
    - Supporting Subdomain: necessary for the business and supports the Core, but not a competitive differentiator; built, but with minimal investment
    - Generic Subdomain: common functionality not specific to the business; acquired, adopted off-the-shelf, or reused rather than built as a strategic asset
    - Classification is always measured against business competitive advantage, regardless of the parent Domain's type: in a Business Domain advantage is direct (customer-facing); in a Technical Domain it is indirect — Core only where the business moat depends on the capability, so most Technical Subdomains are Supporting or Generic
  - Delivers one or more capabilities, each realized by one or more Bounded Contexts — a Subdomain-to-Context relationship that is many-to-many

- `Bounded Context (Context)`: a model boundary in the solution space, with a specific set of actors, concepts, operations, and rules, realizing one or more Subdomains
  - Primary indicators
    - Low coupling to other Contexts
    - Autonomy of evolution (components evolve independently)
    - Team/organizational responsibility
    - Data autonomy
    - A concept with its own lifecycle and model can be a separate Context; if it is only an attribute or target name, it normally belongs inside the Context that uses it
  - Naming: noun (normally plural) or noun phrase
    - Examples: `payments`, `reviews`
  - Title: `# Bounded Context: {slug}`, e.g. `# Bounded Context: checkout`
  - Solution space, both strategic (boundary, Ubiquitous Language) and tactical (the model that realizes it)
  - Describes
    - Executive summary
      - Scope
      - Out of scope
    - External actors
    - `## Relationships` section
      - Relationship graphs follow `Relationship graph rules`
      - Relationship entries follow `Relationship documentation`
    - `## Ubiquitous Language` section
      - The specific, unambiguous dictionary of core nouns and verbs used exclusively within this boundary. Avoid duplicating with Tactical Design Elements
    - Tactical Design Elements stay inside `context.md`: structural elements are documented in `## Model specification`; behavior and lifecycle elements are documented in `## Lifecycle and behavior`
    - `## Model specification` section
      - Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates; include a subsection only when objects of that kind exist
      - Each object subsection may include a field table with `Field`, `Type`, and `Description` columns
      - ERD shows structural fields only; full field semantics live in object subsections
        - Structural fields: identifiers, references, lifecycle state, relationship-bearing fields, aggregate-boundary fields, and invariant-bearing fields
    - `## Lifecycle and behavior` section
      - Factories, Repositories, Services, Events

- `Relationship views`
  - `Service exposure`
    - A runtime or exchange contract exposed by an upstream/provider and consumed by downstream actors or Contexts
    - Examples include UIs, request/response APIs, commands, queries, event/message channels, feeds, exports/imports, files, streams, and external system interfaces
    - Diagram edge styles: `--->` for Open Host Service; `-..->` for Customer-Supplier
    - Service exposure may carry model alignment; that alignment stays with the service exposure relationship
    - `Open Host Service (ohs)`: upstream exposes a public, general-purpose contract for many consumers
    - `Customer-Supplier (c/s)`: upstream provides a contract tailored to one or a few known downstream consumers
  - `Model alignment`
    - A standalone relationship about how one Context depends on, adopts, or translates another Context's language/model
    - Scope: model/language dependencies not carried by a service or integration contract, such as reference terminology, conceptual models, shared classification schemes, or design-time schemas that are not themselves an exchange contract
    - Diagram edge styles: `===>` for Published Language; `--->` for Conformist; `-..->` for Anti-Corruption Layer
    - `Published Language (pl)`: upstream publishes a documented, versioned language/model
    - `Conformist (cf)`: downstream adopts the upstream model as-is, without the upstream publishing a separate formal language for this relationship
    - `Anti-Corruption Layer (acl)`: downstream translates the upstream model into its own model

- `Relationship graph rules`
  - Apply to Domain-level Context Maps and Context-level `## Relationships`
  - Arrows point upstream -> downstream
  - Edge labels are short noun phrases, at most three words, identifying the carried concept or contract
  - Edge labels do not include pattern suffixes
  - Edge styles encode relationship patterns

- `Relationship documentation`
  - Applies to Context-level detailed relationship entries
  - Context-level relationship views cover Bounded Contexts, roles, and external systems that directly provide or consume the focal Context's contracts
  - Sections: `### Service exposure`, `### Model alignment`
  - Each section includes
    - Mermaid graph following `Relationship graph rules`; the focal Context has a distinct node shape
    - Detail subsections for relationships documented in that section
      - Entry order in a Context: incoming relationships first, sorted by upstream name; outgoing/provider relationships second, sorted by downstream name or by provided contract name for one-to-many contracts
  - Detail subsections
    - Headings
      - `#### {upstream} -> {downstream}: {carried concept} ({pattern})`
      - `#### {provider}: {provided interface, language, or model} ({pattern})` for one-to-many provided contracts
      - Pattern suffix
        - Service only: one service exposure pattern in a relationship detail heading under `### Service exposure`, e.g. `(ohs)`, `(c/s)`
        - Service plus model alignment: a composed suffix in a single relationship detail heading under `### Service exposure`, e.g. `(ohs + pl)`, `(ohs + cf)`, `(ohs + acl)`, or the same model suffixes with `c/s`
        - Standalone model alignment: one model-alignment pattern in a relationship detail heading under `### Model alignment`, e.g. `(pl)`, `(cf)`, `(acl)`; only for model/language relationships not carried by a service or integration contract
          - Example: `#### catalog -> search: product classification (acl)`
            - `search` uses `catalog`'s product classification language as a reference model but translates it into local `SearchFacet` and `SearchIndexCategory` concepts
            - No API, event/message channel, feed, export/import, file, or other exchange contract is exposed for this relationship
    - Canonical cross-context details live with the artifact being made canonical:
      - Exposed service or integration contract details live in the upstream/provider Context
      - Published Language (`pl`) details live in the upstream/provider Context
      - Conformist (`cf`) model-alignment details live in the downstream Context that conforms:
        - For service-backed relationships such as `(ohs + cf)` or `(c/s + cf)`, the upstream/provider Context owns the canonical service or integration contract details; the downstream owns its local conformity notes
        - For standalone Conformist (`cf`) model alignment, the upstream should list known downstream conformists, but the detailed relationship entry lives downstream because the upstream publishes no separate formal language for that relationship
      - If the provider is external and has no Context spec, the consuming Context owns local adaptation or translation notes and links to the external provider reference
    - Consumers keep summaries, local conformity/adaptation notes, and links to the provider Context or external provider reference
  - A model stance already described as part of a service exposure relationship has no separate `### Model alignment` entry

- `Tactical Design Elements`
  - `Entity`: has identity and lifecycle (e.g., User, Order, Article)
  - `Value Object`: defined by attributes, immutable, no identity (e.g., Address, Money)
  - `Aggregate`: a cluster of entities and value objects treated as a single consistency boundary; external references point only at its `Aggregate Root`, which enforces the aggregate's invariants
  - `Service`: encapsulates domain operations that span multiple objects and belong to no single entity or value object
  - `Event`: a meaningful occurrence in the domain, modeled as an immutable object (e.g., OrderPlaced)
  - `Repository`: provides collection-like lookup and persistence for Aggregate Roots, hiding storage details
  - `Factory`: encapsulates complex creation of aggregates or entities so their invariants hold from creation

- `Feature`: cohesive set of scenarios within a Context
  - Single object: operations on the same object
  - Cross-object: related operations across multiple objects (workflow)
  - Can involve multiple actors
  - Context contains features, feature belongs to exactly one Context
  - Context defines the nouns (entities); feature defines the behavior over them (actions/verbs)

## Examples
