## Domain specifications section

Section contains to-do items for modifying Domain Design Specifications: Domain Specifications and Bounded Context Specifications.

Domain Design Specification artifacts:

- Domain Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/domain.md`
- Bounded Context Specification: `uspecs/specs/{domain}/{context}/context.md`
  - Owns the Bounded Context's Ubiquitous Language, relationships, tactical design, lifecycle, and behavior
  - Owns all Tactical Design Elements for that Context; the framework does not define separate object specification artifacts

Use when the change affects domain/context actors, concepts, boundaries, relationships, Ubiquitous Language, model, lifecycle, or behavior.

Do not use when: the change only adds features, scenarios, or implementation details within an already-defined domain/context.

## Assessing Domain Design Specification impact

Decide whether Domain Design Specifications need todos from the change request and known or proposed specification names; do not load `uspecs-domains` only to make this impact check.

Add or update a Domain Specification todo when the change affects:

- domain scope or out-of-scope statements
- domain-level external actors
- subdomains, capabilities, or capability-to-context mapping
- the bounded context list, context map, or domain-level relationship indexes
- creation, rename, removal, or reassignment of a bounded context

Add or update a Bounded Context Specification todo when the change affects:

- a context boundary, purpose, ownership, or external actors
- context relationships, service exposure, model alignment, or canonical relationship details
- Ubiquitous Language within a context
- model structure such as Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, fields, or invariants
- context-level lifecycle or model behavior such as Factories, Repositories, Services, Events, invariants, state transitions, or rules that change the context model

Do not add a Domain Design Specification todo when the change only updates feature scenarios, implementation code, tests, provisioning, or technical design within an already-defined domain and context, with no change to actors, boundaries, relationships, language, model, lifecycle, or behavior.

If the change names a likely domain/context impact but the exact modeling answer is unclear, add a targeted todo describing what must be reviewed or updated. Use `uspecs-domains` only when the current task also requires writing or reviewing the artifact content or resolving the modeling choice.

## Rules

- Follow the to-do list format: relative paths from the change file to the target, specific action verbs (create, update, add, fix, remove, rename, move, etc.)
- For `update` action use subitems describing each change
- For `create` action use a single subitem with specification type and brief domain purpose

## Example

```markdown
## Domain specifications

- [ ] create: [softeng/domain.md](../../specs/prod/softeng/domain.md)
  - Domain Specification for software engineering workflow: actors, core concepts, contexts

- [ ] create: [planning/context.md](../../specs/prod/softeng/planning/context.md)
  - Bounded Context Specification for planning workflow: ubiquitous language, relationships, tactical model, lifecycle, and behavior

- [ ] update: [payments/domain.md](../../specs/prod/payments/domain.md)
  - add: "Refund" concept with lifecycle and authorization rules
  - update: "Checkout" context to reference the new Refund concept
```
